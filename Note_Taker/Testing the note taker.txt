## Notes: Testing the Note Taker - Initial Functionality

**Objective:** Verify the note-taking system's basic functionality, specifically the progress bar indicator.

**Procedure:**

1. **Initiate Recording:** The instructor begins by stating they are testing the system.
2. **Observe Progress Bar:** The instructor directs attention to the progress bar, indicating it should be working.
3. **Test Stopping Mechanism:** The instructor attempts to stop the recording *before* it reaches the end.
4. **Verify Stop Functionality:** The instructor confirms they are able to stop the recording.

**Key Observations:**

* The progress bar *appears* to be working initially.
* There is an issue with the progress bar's behavior when the recording is stopped prematurely. The instructor notes it "shouldn't be" working in this scenario.
* The ability to stop the recording is confirmed.

**Potential Issues:**

* The progress bar may not accurately reflect the recording status when stopped mid-process.
* There could be a bug in the progress bar logic related to premature stopping.

**Next Steps:**

* Further investigation is needed to understand why the progress bar malfunctions when stopped early.
* Consider testing with different stopping points to identify the specific conditions causing the issue.
* Document the observed behavior and any error messages encountered.
