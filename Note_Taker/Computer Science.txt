## Computer Science Notes - Lecture Outline

**Tuesday, August 26, 2025**

**Topics:**

1. **Strings:** Introduction to the string object type in Python.
2. **User Input and Output:** Techniques for writing programs that receive input from users and display output.
3. **Conditional Logic:** Implementing decision-making within programs using user input.

### Recap of Last Lecture

* **Objects:** Fundamental building blocks in Python. Each object has a specific type that dictates allowed operations.
* **Variables:** Names that refer to objects stored in memory.
* **Expressions:** Combinations of objects and operators that Python evaluates to produce a value.
    * Mathematical expressions (e.g., `(x + y) * 2`)
    * Command-like expressions (e.g., `radius ** 2`)
* **Assignment Statement:** Creates a new object in memory and binds it to a given variable name. The right-hand side of the `=` is evaluated.
* **Memory Diagram:** Visual representation of objects and their values in memory.
* **Creating Objects:**  Assigning values to variables creates new objects in memory. Modifying objects does not change the original object, but creates a new one.
* **String Object:** A sequence of case-sensitive characters.

### New Topic: Strings

* **Definition:** A string is a sequence of case-sensitive characters.
* **Character Types:** Strings can contain a wide variety of characters, including lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace.
* **String Literals:** Strings are typically enclosed in single quotes (`'...'`) or double quotes (`"..."`).
* **String Operations:** Python provides various built-in operations for manipulating strings, such as:
    * **Concatenation:** Joining two or more strings together.
    * **Slicing:** Extracting a portion of a string.
    * **Indexing:** Accessing individual characters within a string.
    * **String methods:** Functions that perform specific operations on strings (e.g., `upper()`, `lower()`, `strip()`).
